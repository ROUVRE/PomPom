# 🍅 PomPom - A Simple Pomodoro Timer to Help You Study 

Pomodoro Technique is a time-management method developed by Francesco Cirillo. It uses a timer to break work into focused 25-minute intervals (each called a "Pomodoro"), separated by short 5-minute breaks, with longer 15-30 minute breaks after every four pomodoros.

This simple Pomodoro Timer was made to help you focus, manage time, and avoid burnout while working or studying.

Made using React 19.

**WARNING:** Currently it is bugged on mobile. Working for a fix
